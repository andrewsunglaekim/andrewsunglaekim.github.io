<h2>Small Time Grocer</h2>
<img src="/images/small_time_grocer.png">

> Small-Time Grocer was my very first project at General Assembly. It is an organizational tool for small grocery and convenience store owners. The app is built on the Sinatra web framework and was constructed with just 4 weeks of class instruction and 4 weeks self taught programming experience.

<h2>Drizz.ly</h2>
<img src="/images/drizzly.png">

> Drizzly was a group mini project that we developed in less than 12 hours. It's built on Rails and utilizes the weather underground API. After about a week of instruction on javascript, our group utilized the newly garnered asset to make a single page app that gives weather information.
